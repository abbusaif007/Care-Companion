AI Chatbot for Health

The main aim of this project is to create a chatbot for a given website. Here we are using the Tamil Nadu health website. The data will be scraped from the website and stored in CSV format.
We will be using Dialogflow as the main api for building the bot. In Dialogflow, an intent will be created, and data that was scraped from the website will be stored as a knowledge base. 
Then the bot will be deployed. The code will be stored in GitHub and integrated with CloudFlare.
For the frontend, we are using Tailwind CSS. And we will integrate the chatbot deployed in Dialogflow with the website.
